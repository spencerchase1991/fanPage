        <h4>
            NSYNC was an American boy band formed in Orlando, Florida, in 1995 and launched in Germany by BMG Ariola
            Munich. NSYNC consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass.
            After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager Lou Pearlman and former record label
            Bertelsmann Music Group, the group's second album, No Strings Attached (2000), sold over one million copies
            in one day and 2.42 million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. Among the group's
            singles, "I Want You Back", "Bye Bye Bye", "This I Promise You", "Girlfriend", "Pop" and "It's Gonna Be Me"
            reached the top 10 in several international charts, with the latter being a US Billboard Hot 100 number one.
            In addition to a host of Grammy Award nominations, NSYNC has performed at the World Series, the Super Bowl
            and the Olympic Games, and sang or recorded with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson,
            Britney Spears, Phil Collins, Celine Dion, Aerosmith, Nelly, Left Eye, Mary J. Blige, country music
            supergroup Alabama, and Gloria Estefan.

        Although NSYNC announced the start of a "temporary hiatus" in early 2002, the band has not recorded new material
        since then. In 2007, Lance Bass confirmed that the group had "definitely broken up". The band completed five
        nationwide concert tours and has sold between 50 and 70 million records, becoming the fifth-best-selling boy
        band in history. Rolling Stone recognized their instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments
        of all time. Justin Timberlake went on to become one of the world's best-selling music artists, with more than
        32 million albums and 56 million singles sold throughout his solo career.
